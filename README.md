# Overview

The previous lab included a brief discussion of the fundamentals of a machine learning workflow.

Step 1- identify the problem or question, think about options for answering or solving, and decide if machine learning will be a useful tool.

Step 2- identify and analyze available datasets to see if sufficient data is available to build a model

Step 3- transform the data into a tabular structure so it can be the input for a machine learning model

Step 4- train the model (or more accurately engage in an iterative process of training the model)

Step 5- evaluate the model to see if (and how effectively) it solves the original question/problem

Step 6- deploy the model

Our goal in this lab is for you to come up with a problem or question that can be answered via machine learning and build a model that responds to that question/problem.

Simple, right?

As you can imagine, this is an iterative process that takes TIME.

Time to determine the central problem or question, and figure out if machine learning is a good fit.

Time to figure out what data is needed to build a model, identify or collect that data, and wrangle it into a tabular structure.

Time to figure out what type of model is the best fit for the question/problem AS WELL AS the input data.

Time to train the model and evaluate the effectiveness of the model.

Time to figure out what the model has to say about your original question or problem.

In short, TIME.

Which is why we're spending two weeks on this lab and working collaboratively.

There is no formal procedure or workflow.

Use the six steps above and resources outlined below.

# Resources

Starting with a method or concept's Wikipedia page can give you the broad strokes as well as links or citatations for additional resources.

Andreas C. MÃ¼ller and Sarah Guide's accessible *Introduction to Machine learning With Python: A Guide for Data Scientists* (O'Reilly, 2017) is where I would start with additional research.

# Lab Notebook Components

Your lab notebook includes narrative reflection and code + comments that address your work on each of the following components:

Part 1: Identify the problem or question, think about options for answering or solving, and decide if machine learning will be a useful tool.

Part 2: Identify and analyze available datasets to see if sufficient data is available to build a model

Part 3: Transform the data into a tabular structure so it can be the input for a machine learning model

Part 4: Train the model (or more accurately engage in an iterative process of training the model)

Part 5: Evaluate the model to see if (and how effectively) it solves the original question/problem

Part 6: Deploy the model and reflect on the experience

Some parts will consist of more written narrative. Others will focus more on code + comments. This is fine.

The notebook can include a text document and accompanying `.py` files. But a Jupyter notebook is also a good option for this type of report-based lab notebook.

The Part 6 reflection should include comments from each member of the group.
