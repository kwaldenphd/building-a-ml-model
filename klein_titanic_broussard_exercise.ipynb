More specifially, it's a *supervised* machine learning model that is used to predict a target (in our case, whether a person survives or not) by learning *decision* rules from features (in our case specific columns in our dataset). One of the most helpful features of decision trees, for our purposes, is that it can tell us which features are most important for making the prediction.  \n",
